3. Set your remote URL to a form that supports SSH 1

If you have done the steps above and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the form

git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
as opposed to

https://github.com/username/reponame.git
To see your repo URL, run:

git remote show origin
You can change the URL with:

git remote set-url origin git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
```
